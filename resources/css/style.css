Then adding a rule to copyright txt by selecting only p elements nested within (child of) .footer,and adding a value of 11px.

still Not sure why selector of tag <p> was overriding (more specific) class .footer in a prev version(?)

Also it seems css selector <a> overrides tag <p> (in a previous version), not sure why(?) */
